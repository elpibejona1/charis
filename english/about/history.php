					<p>The Brethren movement began in Germany in 1708 when Alexander Mack and seven others were baptized, leading to the creation of churches whose passion was to return to the Scriptures for all matters of faith and practice. Many of these pioneers were forced to flee to the American colonies in order to freely practice their beliefs.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="timeline__event">
					<p>Though the movement grew, it was not until 1900 that missions came to the forefront. One of the leaders of the progressive brethren, named Jacob Cassel, gave a stirring appeal for world evangelism and called for the creation of a foreign mission organization. He told the delegates:</p>
					<p class="center"><span class="highlight">“If the evangelization of the world is to you what the north star is for a sailor; if you will always take your bearings from that God-focalized center, your responsibility will be met.”</span></p>

					<p>His words were electrifying for many of the delegates. However, the leader of the conference, not wanting to interrupt the flow of his agenda, told the mission enthusiasts that there was plenty of room under the trees if they wanted their missionary organization. Accordingly, 53 people went from the conference to a spot under the trees, to launch the most significant movement in Brethren history.</p>

The global impact of the Brethren would eventually extend to the four corners of the world. Today the sun never sets on a Grace Brethren church.</p>

						<p>A “Bible Coach” was purchased, bringing identity to the mission and creating opportunities for open-air meetings and literature distribution. This at times provoked fierce opposition, but as more missionaries joined the team, they were able to reach into the hearts of the Argentine people, seeing churches established in many of the cities of the province. Eventually a Bible Institute was established to train leadership for these churches. A camp gave focus to a growing youth work, and radio ministry began and developed.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="timeline__event timeline__event--half">
						<p>Though the first chapters of the ministry focused on the cities of the interior, the people of Argentina were following the global trend of moving to the larger cities. In 1947 the first congregation in Buenos Aires was established. Today Brethren churches are scattered throughout the county. Through the faithful leadership training of the missionaries, all of these churches established are now led by Argentines.</p>

						<h2>1951: Brazil</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="timeline__event">
						<p>Between the two world wars the vision of Brethren missions focused on Argentina and Africa. This would change in the early 1950s. Under the leadership of Dr. Russell Barnard, the mission would experience a period of rapid expansion. In their 1951 meeting the board interviewed 40 missionaries and candidates, and during the decade that followed, missionaries departed for five new fields.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="timeline__event timeline__event--half">
						<p>The first of these was Brazil. Keith and Vivian Altig were the first to respond to God’s call to that country. One of their first converts, Raimundo Cardoso, had been warned by a priest not to look into their black book, the Bible, for fear of becoming blind. He became the first Brazilian pastor. Their target city, Belem, was at the mouth of the Amazon River.</p>

						<p>Other missionaries soon joined them, including Bill and Imogene Burk. Bill used the Amazon River as God’s instrument for reaching people. With their boat, the Vamos, they evangelized and planted churches on the islands, bring the message to these people for the first time. Converts were discipled, men were trained to be leaders, and these new leaders were immediately given responsibility for the ministry, following the patterns of the book of Acts.</p>

						<h2>1951: Mexico</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="timeline__event">
						<p>Though Mexico was just across the border from the United States, it was not until 1951 that it became a part of Grace Brethren missions. The first missionaries to Mexico were the Haags and the Howards. After surveying the situation, they realized that the most densely populated area was along the Mexican border. The missionaries settled on the United States side, just across from Tijuana, where many churches were planted.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="timeline__event timeline__event--half">
						<p>Later the ministry was extended further east, near Mexicali. As the work progressed a Bible Institute began in 1960, providing training for those who were now pastoring the churches that had been established.

						<p>The vision for reaching Mexicans soon reached beyond the border cities. In 1963 the Brethren work in Mexico City was pioneered, with university students being one of the main target groups. Mexico City, the largest city in the world, soon became the principal target for outreach. A number of churches were planted in the cities in the area, and a fellowship of Mexican leaders was formed. In addition to the Mexican churches being planted, teams of Mexicans were sent to Cuba.</p>

Soon realizing that the French could not be reached without seeing evidence of Christ in the lives of His followers, they were able to begin a ministry in a 14th century castle which the Lord provided in the village of Saint-Albain.</p>

						<p>Chad is an extraordinary example of what can be accomplished when we are filled with the desire to be used of the Lord. In 1998 a training institute was held at the Chateau of Saint Albain for African pastors. Travelling with them was a layman, a builder by trade. The pastors said that he could sit in the library while they took their classes, but of course he was invited to all the courses; the subject was church-planting.</p>

The church experienced some inner tension, but the Lord brought encouragement by calling the Pappas family to Germany as co-laborers, and the church experienced a period of excitement and growth.</p>
