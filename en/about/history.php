						<h2>NEED YEAR: Portugal</h2>
						<p>It was the vision of Jack Zielasko which opened the ministry in Portugal. The Zielaskos had served for 14 years in Brazil before Jack became the Executive Director of Grace Brethren Missions. Because of their knowledge of Portuguese, they became burdened for the mother country of that language, a country impoverished by years of dictatorship and colonial wars.</p>
						<p>The majority of the Portuguese are Catholics, but only a minority regularly practice their religion. Protestants represent only slightly more than 1% of the population, with far fewer being evangelical. The Zielaskos were soon joined by Tim and Julie Hawkins and Ralph and Martha Schwartz, followed later by their son and his wife, Sam and Tracey.</p>

						<p>Most of the ministry in Portugal has centered in the city of Porto and has focused on personal contact-making and the creation of small groups, of which a number were started in the area. The missionaries cooperated with other workers in establishing an international church, which has been instrumental in reaching out also into Portuguese families. A number of Portuguese men have been trained as leaders of the ministry, and have faithfully fulfilled their responsibilities. One of these, Alfredo Abreu, who had been serving in a campus ministry, later moved with his family to the capitol, Lisbon, to seek to build up a body of believers there. He has been joined by Sam and Tracey Schwartz, and their ministries have resulted in planting a church. There are currently four organized churches in Portugal with the Brethren fellowship.</p>

						<h2>1990s: The Beginnings of an International&nbsp;Identity</h2>
						<p>The vision of an international fellowship of Grace Brethren churches goes back many decades. Periodically a proposal would be made at National Conference for the creation of an international conference, but would almost immediately be tabled because of the obstacles involved in making it happen. Too many questions seemed unanswerable. Who would be invited? How would they be chosen? How would a global gathering of Grace Brethren churches be financed? What would be the guiding purpose?</p>
						<p>At the 1990 conference there was serious discussion concerning the need to give churches an international identity, but again it appeared that because of the hurdles involved, an international fellowship would never be more than a dream.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="timeline__event">
						<p>Those involved with Grace Brethren International Missions knew, however, that some day the dream would have to become a reality in order to allow churches around the globe to preserve their Grace Brethren identities. Whenever churches are established throughout the world, the mission plays an apostolic role, usually perceived as the role of a parent. The identity of a church is closely related to the mission until the time several congregations can organize themselves into a national fellowship, usually following the pattern of the sending churches. At this time the churches become autonomous, making their own decisions, and seeking to provide for their own needs.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="timeline__event">
						<p>When this autonomy becomes a reality, the churches begin to phase out their relationship with the mission. However, this forces to them phase out their relationship with the only entity that has given them a sense of global identity. As the mission moves into the background, something has to take its place, or the churches will become increasingly provincial and cut off from the rest of the world.</p>
						<p>Therefore, the main purpose of an international fellowship, whatever the form it assumes, is to give global vision and identity to church fellowships. They must know that they are a part of a larger family than their local churches. And they must know that their mission and ministry go beyond their own back yard.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="timeline__event">
						<p>At the 1993 National Conference of the Fellowship of Grace Brethren Churches (FGBC) in Billings, Mont., serious dialogues occurred concerning this need and how to meet it. These discussions, which took place in encounters with the field superintendents (of Grace Brethren International Missions) rather than on the conference floor, opened the way to the first international gathering representing a global fellowship. Three key guidelines were established concerning the nature of an international gathering:</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>Charis would be an international gathering of leaders, rather than churches.</li>
							<li>These leaders would meet somewhere outside the United States.</li>
							<li>This endeavor would be led by a national, not by an American.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="timeline__event">
						<p>It was also determined that:</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>The place of the first meeting would be the Ch√¢teau of Saint-Albain in France.</li>
							<li>Florent Varak, pastor of the Grace Brethren Church in Lyon, France, would be asked to give leadership to the gathering.</li>
							<li>The time of the meeting would be October of 1994.</li>
							<li>The Field Superintendents would be responsible for inviting at least one delegate from each country.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="timeline__event">
						<p>The name <span>Charis</span> was chosen, to represent Grace in any language. It would be called the <span>Charis International Alliance</span>, since it was to be a fraternity of leaders, and not an organization. The overall purpose would be to promote international church planting.</p>
						<p>Accordingly, on October 3, 1994, delegates from fifteen countries converged on the Ch√¢teau of Saint Albain, France, for the first meeting of the <span>Charis International Alliance</span>.</p>
