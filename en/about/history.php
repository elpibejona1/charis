						<h2>1951: Mexico</h2>
						<p>Though Mexico was just across the border from the United States, it was not until 1951 that it became a part of Grace Brethren missions. The first missionaries to Mexico were the Haags and the Howards. After surveying the situation, they realized that the most densely populated area was along the Mexican border. The missionaries settled on the United States side, just across from Tijuana, where many churches were planted.</p>
						<p>Later the ministry was extended further east, near Mexicali. As the work progressed a Bible Institute began in 1960, providing training for those who were now pastoring the churches that had been established. Because of its proximity to the United States, the Mexican churches have through the years benefitted from the ministry of American teams.</p>

						<h2>1951: France</h2>
						<p>Europe was off the mission map until American servicemen returned with their accounts of the dire spiritual condition of that continent. The land of the Reformation and the birthplace of the Brethren movement had become a post-Christian continent.</p>
						<p>As a part of the initial wave of postwar missionaries, Fred and Maurita Fogle left for France in 1951, joining the staff of the European Bible Institute some years later. Tom and Doris Julien left in 1958 and after a year of French studies in Geneva moved to Grenoble where they engaged in literature distribution, camp work, and collaboration with some of the few evangelical churches there. Soon realizing that the French could not be reached without seeing evidence of Christ in the lives of His followers, they were able to begin a ministry in a 14th century castle which the Lord provided in the village of Saint-Albain.</p>

Six churches were planted in surrounding cities during the first two decades of the ministry.</p>
						<p>The Chateau also became a Bible training center, an encounter center for strategic discussions between mission organizations, and a center for a European branch of Grace Theological Seminary. The Chateau was used of the Lord for putting Europe on the map of Grace Brethren missions, with more than 100 missionaries later coming to Europe for varying periods of ministry.</p>

						<h2>1966: Chad</h2>
						<p>The Republic of Chad lies just across the northern border of the Central African Republic. Jake and Freda Kliever began their ministry in the CAR in 1937, but moved into Chad in 1966, where they served as the pioneer missionaries for ten years. This move was later duplicated by several other families at various periods of time.</p>
						<p>The Chadians were very open to the Gospel, and quickly churches began to be planted in the villages and cities of the southern part of the country. Without exception these churches were led by the Chadian pastors.</p>

						<p>In 1998 a training institute was held in France at the Chateau of Saint Albain for African pastors. Travelling with them was a layman, a builder by trade. The pastors said that he could sit in the library while they took their classes, but of course he was invited to all the courses; the subject was church-planting. After three weeks of studies, he returned to his country, built what he called his Chateau, and began to train evangelists and send them out. Not only were hundreds of new churches planted throughout Chad, but he also sent evangelists to Nigeria as well as to Cameroon. He was on his way to evangelize Libya when because of a breakdown in the Sahara desert he later died.</p>
						<p>Samuel Dadjé will always be remembered as perhaps the most outstanding pioneer of Brethren missions.</p>

						<h2>1968: Germany</h2>
						<p>In 1968 a team of Brethren men went to Germany, the birth place of the fellowship, to explore the opportunity to plant the kind of churches our founder, Alexander Mack, had desired to see. In response to this trip, the mission commissioned Roger and Nancy Peugh to take the Word of God back to Germany. Roger had already served there on a short-term basis, and was fluent in German.</p>
						<p>The first few years were challenging, but in 1972 the Peughs began holding Bible studies and worship services in their home, praying much for conversions. Later an evangelistic crusade was organized, providing the initial contacts for the beginning of a church in Stuttgart, which was incorporated in 1976 and began meeting in a rented facility. The church experienced some inner tension, but the Lord brought encouragement by calling the Pappas family to Germany as co-laborers, and the church experienced a period of excitement and growth.</p>

						<h2>1980: United Kingdom</h2>
						<p>Serious prayer for revival in Europe began in 1980, and that fall the Europe missionaries gathered for a week of prayer, reflection and planning. Out of this came the commitment to see the missionaries of Europe as a united team, reaching out into new countries. One of these was England. After an exploratory trip, the decision was made to send Phil and Elinor Steele, joined by Dave and Cindy Kowalke, to the city of Birmingham.</p>
						<p>Within a short amount of time services were started in a vacant church building, and quickly a sizeable group assembled for the Sunday services. Unfortunately most of these people were from other churches rather than converts, and the ministry only continued for a few years. A new team began to form, and services began in a school building. Many of the new people were contacted through the guitar classes begun by Dave Schwan, who came to England with his wife Becky in 1988. The church grew, and is under British leadership. A branch church was begun by the Schwans in another suburb of Birmingham, which has also seen encouraging growth, and commitment to outreach in the community.</p>

						<h2>1984: Japan</h2>
						<p>It was the vision of Jay Bell, a member of the staff at the Long Beach California church, that opened Asia to Grace Brethren missions. After four years of serious praying by Jay and his wife Jan, the Long Beach church sent the first of the mission’s missionaries to Asia. One of the couples sent was Cecil and Debbie O’Dell to Japan. Japan was already on the hearts of the O’Dells through their ministry to Japanese students in Long Beach. They became missionaries to Japan in 1984, choosing Hoya City in the greater Tokyo area to begin their ministry.</p>
						<p>They and the missionaries who joined them have had to exhibit exceptional commitment and perseverance, because of the hardness of the soil in Japan. As is true in all resistant populations, evangelism is done through relationships, leading to small groups. The key to reaching Japan is prayer. The spiritual powers have blinded the minds of the people.</p>

In addition, the mission more recently acquired a center in the mountainous region of the country, called North Star, which serves as a base and bridge for the ministries.

						<h2>1984: The Philippines</h2>
						<p>During the same year that the ministry in Japan began, Clay and Kim Hulett left for the Philippines, to be joined soon after by Ted and Vivian Ruiz. They quickly learned that in the Philippines life revolves around neighborhoods called “barangays.” The barangay is a municipal unit. The vision of the missionaries was to see a church in each barangay.</p>
						<p>After their language studies, the Huletts prayed that the Lord would lead them to the barangay where they should begin their ministry. Knowing no one, Kim simply followed the Lord’s leading and walked into the barangay of Calumpang, where the ministry was started. There Clay soon met Rey Paz. They began studying the Bible together, and Rey became the first Filipino convert, and the first Grace Brethren pastor. Rey remains, after all these years, a faithful leader of the churches there.</p>

						<p>The responsiveness of the Filipinos, coupled with their ability to speak English, has made short-term teams an effective means of reaching the population. The Ruizes targeted the settlements along the famous Sumulong highway, using short-term teams. Soon six groups of believers began meeting in homes. Since then the ministry spread through neighboring communities and far beyond the boundaries of Manila, resulting in multiple churches. During the years of ministry in the Philippines, much effort has been expended in training leaders through a training program, and other effective ministries have branched off. The friendliness of the Filipinos and their openness to the gospel has been a continual encouragement.</p>

						<h2>NEED YEAR: Portugal</h2>
						<p>It was the vision of Jack Zielasko which opened the ministry in Portugal. The Zielaskos had served for 14 years in Brazil before Jack became the Executive Director of Grace Brethren Missions. Because of their knowledge of Portuguese, they became burdened for the mother country of that language, a country impoverished by years of dictatorship and colonial wars.</p>
						<p>The majority of the Portuguese are Catholics, but only a minority regularly practice their religion. Protestants represent only slightly more than 1% of the population, with far fewer being evangelical. The Zielaskos were soon joined by Tim and Julie Hawkins and Ralph and Martha Schwartz, followed later by their son and his wife, Sam and Tracey.</p>

						<p>Most of the ministry in Portugal has centered in the city of Porto and has focused on personal contact-making and the creation of small groups, of which a number were started in the area. The missionaries cooperated with other workers in establishing an international church, which has been instrumental in reaching out also into Portuguese families. A number of Portuguese men have been trained as leaders of the ministry, and have faithfully fulfilled their responsibilities. One of these, Alfredo Abreu, who had been serving in a campus ministry, later moved with his family to the capitol, Lisbon, to seek to build up a body of believers there. He has been joined by Sam and Tracey Schwartz, and their ministries have resulted in planting a church. There are currently four organized churches in Portugal with the Brethren fellowship.</p>

						<h2>1990s: The Beginnings of an International&nbsp;Identity</h2>
						<p>The vision of an international fellowship of Grace Brethren churches goes back many decades. Periodically a proposal would be made at National Conference for the creation of an international conference, but would almost immediately be tabled because of the obstacles involved in making it happen. Too many questions seemed unanswerable. Who would be invited? How would they be chosen? How would a global gathering of Grace Brethren churches be financed? What would be the guiding purpose?</p>
						<p>At the 1990 conference there was serious discussion concerning the need to give churches an international identity, but again it appeared that because of the hurdles involved, an international fellowship would never be more than a dream.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="timeline__event">
						<p>Those involved with Grace Brethren International Missions knew, however, that some day the dream would have to become a reality in order to allow churches around the globe to preserve their Grace Brethren identities. Whenever churches are established throughout the world, the mission plays an apostolic role, usually perceived as the role of a parent. The identity of a church is closely related to the mission until the time several congregations can organize themselves into a national fellowship, usually following the pattern of the sending churches. At this time the churches become autonomous, making their own decisions, and seeking to provide for their own needs.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="timeline__event">
						<p>When this autonomy becomes a reality, the churches begin to phase out their relationship with the mission. However, this forces to them phase out their relationship with the only entity that has given them a sense of global identity. As the mission moves into the background, something has to take its place, or the churches will become increasingly provincial and cut off from the rest of the world.</p>
						<p>Therefore, the main purpose of an international fellowship, whatever the form it assumes, is to give global vision and identity to church fellowships. They must know that they are a part of a larger family than their local churches. And they must know that their mission and ministry go beyond their own back yard.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="timeline__event">
						<p>At the 1993 National Conference of the Fellowship of Grace Brethren Churches (FGBC) in Billings, Mont., serious dialogues occurred concerning this need and how to meet it. These discussions, which took place in encounters with the field superintendents (of Grace Brethren International Missions) rather than on the conference floor, opened the way to the first international gathering representing a global fellowship. Three key guidelines were established concerning the nature of an international gathering:</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>Charis would be an international gathering of leaders, rather than churches.</li>
							<li>These leaders would meet somewhere outside the United States.</li>
							<li>This endeavor would be led by a national, not by an American.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="timeline__event">
						<p>It was also determined that:</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>The place of the first meeting would be the Château of Saint-Albain in France.</li>
							<li>Florent Varak, pastor of the Grace Brethren Church in Lyon, France, would be asked to give leadership to the gathering.</li>
							<li>The time of the meeting would be October of 1994.</li>
							<li>The Field Superintendents would be responsible for inviting at least one delegate from each country.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="timeline__event">
						<p>The name <span>Charis</span> was chosen, to represent Grace in any language. It would be called the <span>Charis International Alliance</span>, since it was to be a fraternity of leaders, and not an organization. The overall purpose would be to promote international church planting.</p>
						<p>Accordingly, on October 3, 1994, delegates from fifteen countries converged on the Château of Saint Albain, France, for the first meeting of the <span>Charis International Alliance</span>.</p>

						<h2>1994: Charis Gathering in Saint-Albain, France</h2>
						<p>The first gathering of the Charis Alliance was an exceptional experience for the participants, many of who had never been out of their respective countries. Not only were they exposed to the world and its spiritual needs; they learned that the Grace Brethren fellowship of churches was a global movement. There was an immediate bonding of the participants in spite of the great diversity of language and culture. They knew that they were members of the same global family.</p>
						<p>This gathering followed the guidelines formulated at the meeting of the field superintendents in Billings.</p>
						<p>First, it was a meeting of leaders, and not churches. Of the 35 participants, 13 were national leaders from their country. Thirteen missionaries came alongside these nationals as teammates for the delegates. The other nine participants were invited guests, American except for two additional brethren from Africa.</p>

					<div class="timeline__event">
						<p>Second, it was held outside the United States. The Château of Saint-Albain proved to be the logical place for the first gathering of the Charis Alliance. The facilities provided lodging and meals at a reasonable cost. The rustic setting diminished the material impact of the gathering on those coming from third-world countries. Transportation was available and comparatively inexpensive, especially for the delegates from Africa and Europe. Florent Varak, the coordinator,lived just 50 miles away. Further, the focus of prayer and ministry at the Château created a spiritual impact that was sensed by the participants.</p>
						<p></p>
					</div>
					<div class="timeline__event">
						<p>Third, it was led by a national. The wisdom of choosing Florent Varak became immediately evident, from his positive attitude toward the ministry, his vision, his leadership charisma, and his organizational skills. Assisted by Encompass missionary Kent Good, who became a link with the mission, Florent planned a program that provided both the necessary input to make the gathering significant in the lives of the participants, as well as giving opportunity for freedom of participation for all who were there.</p>
						<p>Intense discussion on a wide range of subjects occurred during the course of this gathering. At times much of it was related to the material needs of the churches in countries less favored economically, and how to meet those needs without violating indigenous principles. The possibility of visits of the national leaders to other countries was discussed. A great deal of time was spent discussing ways of maintaining better communication between the various countries involved.</p>

						<p>In all these discussions, it was the consensus of the delegates that Charis must not become an organization with authority to impose its decisions upon the churches. It would always be a fraternity of the representatives sent by the churches.</p>
						<p>In view of his fine work, Florent Varak was asked to continue as coordinator of Charis, through the next conference. Steve Peters, future moderator of the U.S. fellowship of churches, gave an official invitation to	Charis to meet at Toronto during the National Conference of the Fellowship of Grace Brethren Churches (USA) in 1996.</p>
						<p>In his letter to the participants of the conference, Florent Varak wrote:</p>
						<p class="center"><span class="highlight">“I have always felt a spiritual bond with French and American Grace Brethren churches, this being all I have known, but I had never known the extent, nor the beauty—of our fellowship worldwide. My vision has been stretched and my passion renewed. I have been humbled and challenged by the qualities	displayed in our lives and ministries and commitments. Praise and glory be to God!”</span></p>

						<h2>1996: Charis Gathering in Toronto, Canada</h2>
						<p>On July 24 the second global gathering of the Charis Alliance convened in Toronto, Canada. Fourteen delegates represented 15 countries. They were joined by 16 missionary representatives, and 17 observers.</p>
						<p>The Charis meeting was held in Toronto at the invitation of the moderator of the National Fellowship of Grace Brethren Churches (USA). This was to expose the delegates to the conference, which was held in Toronto that year, and to take advantage of the presence of the missionaries attending conference.</p>

						<p>Florent Varak, again the coordinator for the Charis gathering, led discussions on Charis identity, mission, goals, and definitions. The group approved the following items:</p>
						<p><strong>Charis identity:</strong> Charis is a multinational network of Grace Brethren church planters and developers.</p>
						<p><strong>Charis Mission:</strong> The mission of Charis is to promote church planting worldwide, by facilitating communication, by encouraging the exchange of needs and resources, and by soliciting the opening of new fields.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="timeline__event">
						<p><strong>Charis Goals:</strong></p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>To chart the progress of new church planting efforts around the world, through a quarterly English news bulletin (Prayer and Praise)</li>
							<li>To maintain a current list of the most rapid means of communication between countries between urgent prayer requests and special needs.</li>
							<li>To issue a bi-annual list of missionary projects</li>
							<li>To organize a world conference in three years</li>
							<li>And if possible, a continental conference before that time.</li>

					<div class="timeline__event">
						<p><strong>Charis Definitions:</strong> A missionary project is a measurable task related to church planting with a specific budget and time frame, owned by local church(es), approved by a national fellowship of churches (if necessary), under the responsibility of a church leader.</p>
						<p>It was determined that the next conference would take place in Argentina, in order to allow Charis to convene during the 90th anniversary of the Argentine churches.</p>

						<h2>1997: Cambodia</h2>
						<p>Grace Brethren missions began in Cambodia through a Cambodian believer, Vek Huong Taing, who had formed a friendship with Jay Bell in the Long Beach church. Huong and his wife had survived the “killing fields,” four years of terror during which the Khmer Rouge had murdered nearly one-third of the population. Huong had begun evangelizing Cambodian refugees in Thailand, and invited the American brethren for some exploratory trips, leading to the involvement of several American churches sending teams to Cambodia.</p>
						<p>The tragic events of that country opened many thousands to the gospel. In 1997 the Grace Brethren movement consisted of three traditional churches ministering to 155 people. One month later apostolic teams were launched on motorbikes into the villages surrounding the city of Battambang. By the end of the decade nearly eighty Points of Light, a term designating house groups that were becoming churches, could count 1,000 adults. All of this was carried on with the cooperation of teams from American churches.</p>

						<p>The principles of Charis were reiterated:</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li><strong>Organization:</strong> we are organized but we do not have organizational structure.</li>
							<li><strong>Relationship with the American mission agency:</strong> we share the same objectives but maintain our autonomy in implementing them.</li>

						<p>During these meetings, the discussion focused on the following questions:</p>

							<li><strong>In your opinion, what is Charis?</strong> The answers were unified: we are an international fraternity of leaders of the Grace Brethren movement.</li>
							<li><strong>What do you expect from Charis?</strong> The answers differed. Many wanted something more closely knit together than in the past. They wanted more than just a networking of information.</li>
							<li><strong>What do you think have been the principal achievements of Charis?</strong> The achievements discussed included churches that had been planted and alliances that had been formed. Charis had helped member countries get to know each other. It had given them an identity and shown them that they were not alone.</li>

					<div class="timeline__event">
						<ul class="list list--margin">

Others wanted more European representation. It was also suggested that Charis learn from other similar organizations. The need to launch a missionary movement was also discusse along with the need for news to be more concise.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>At the conclusion of the gathering, the delegates proposed that future Charis meetings continue a similar fashion. A conference would be held periodically with the location to be determined at the previous meeting. </p>

						<h2>2008: Charis Gathering in Bad Homburg, Germany</h2>
						<p>Leaders from Grace Brethren fellowships around the world gathered near Frankfurt, Germany, for a week-long conference in early August, 2008. Some 55 Grace Brethren from many parts of the globe gathered for information, encouragement, and strategizing about God’s work through Grace Brethren people around the world.</p>
						<p>Representatives came from 16 of the 33 nations in the world where there were Grace Brethren churches or beginning works at that time. They met at Bad Homburg Youth Hostel near the Frankfurt airport the week of August 2-9. The week’s theme was “Faithful Stewards of God’s Grace,” based on 1 Peter 4:10.</p>

These included Francois Ngoumape from the Central African Republic; Adan Panizales from the Philippines; Florent Varak from France; Jorge Nunez from Argentina; and Keith Shearer from North America. Rainer Ehmann of Germany was the conference coordinator and host, and the coordinator of the planning committee was David Guiles, executive director of Encompass World Partners.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="timeline__event">
						<p>The week consisted of four kinds of program events. Representatives of each country or continent gave reports of what God has been doing through their churches. In addition, major addresses were given in the areas of Brethren history (David Plaster), biblical truth (Keith Shearer), and holism ministries (Jorge Nunez). Worldwide audits of Grace Brethren church-planting, leadership training, and holism ministries had been prepared by Nate Dunlevy, Mike McCaman, and Mike Yoder of the Encompass staff.</p>
						<p>During the last several days, the group divided into three sub-groupings, according to their interest in church planting, leadership development, or integrated ministries. Each group developed a short, forward-looking statement, and these were then combined into a one-page <span>Commitment to Common Mission</span> statement that provides forward-thinking direction and intention for the worldwide Grace Brethren fellowship for at least the next decade.</p>

						<h2>2010: Charis Gathering in Saint-Albain, France</h2>
						<p>Nearly 20 leaders of Grace Brethren fellowships from around the globe met in September at the Château Saint-Albain in France. The purpose was to discuss strategy for the Charis movement over the next ten years.</p>
						<p>One topic for discussion was the <span>Commitment to Common Mission</span>, which was crafted during the 2008 meeting at Bad Homburg, Germany. That document revealed the intention of Grace Brethren worldwide to progress over the next decade in the areas of evangelism, leadership development, and integrated, or holistic ministries. In the years following the meeting in Germany, the document was processed and endorsed by leadership and organizations representing all 35 countries where Grace Brethren congregations exist.</p>

						<p>The group identified the need for a commitment to common identity. Until this time, most Grace Brethren church activity outside the U.S. was under the auspices of Grace Brethren North American Missions with no mechanism to handle requests from other groups to join the movement. Rather than create a new organization, Charis leaders agreed to an interim strategy whereby the nearest Grace Brethren fellowship would be the evaluator of any candidate’s commitment to biblical truth, biblical relationships, and biblical mission.</p>
